# GardenExpScript
Python Script To Do Math For Garden
Simulates visitors and works out average garden exp per visitor in a pool
Give an average number of visitors to get a given amount fo garden exp
Gives the estimated time to get that exp while farming or while afking
Note crops like cactus only buff visitor rates by 2.5x and so estimated time will be wrong
